Process definitions

  Each openflow will have one or more process definitions. 
  Each process definition describes a workflow made of activities connected by transitions.

  The process definition is a static entity.
  Running a process will create an instance of that process: a process instance.
  Work will be done on the instance following the workflow described in the process definition.
