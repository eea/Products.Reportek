<h1>Legal notice for CDR datasets</h1>
<h2>Accessing CDR datasets</h2>
<p>
<em>As a general principle, datasets on CDR are publicly available unless they have explicitly been
access-restricted due for instance to protection of privacy, public security, commercial interests
or otherwise have sensitive content.</em>
</p>
<p>
With regards to the right to access CDR datasets, the EEA thus follows the policy related to documents
owned or held by the European Parliament, Council and Commission as regulated through 
<a class="link-pdf" href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/PDF/r1049_en.pdf">Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001</a>
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding
public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, in environmentally related matters, access to datasets owned by a country
is governed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)
<a class="link-pdf" href="http://www.unece.org/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf">Convention on Access to Information,
 Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters</a>
adopted on 25 June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus (Ã…rhus).
